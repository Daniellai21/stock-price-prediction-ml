\# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning



A machine learning project exploring stock price prediction using traditional ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM networks).



\## Project Status

🚧 \*\*In Progress\*\* - Currently completed: Data collection and exploratory data analysis



\## Tech Stack

\- Python 3.x

\- pandas, numpy - Data manipulation

\- yfinance - Stock data API

\- scikit-learn - ML models

\- TensorFlow/Keras - Deep learning

\- matplotlib - Visualization

\## Current Progress

\- ✅ Week 1: Data collection and EDA

\- ⏳ Week 2: Feature engineering and baseline models

\- ⏳ Week 3: Deep learning implementation



\## Goals

Build a comprehensive stock price prediction system demonstrating:

\- Time series analysis

\- Feature engineering for financial data

\- ML model comparison

\- Deep learning for sequence prediction

\- Proper backtesting methodology



\## Running the Project

```bash

\# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/stock-price-prediction-ml.git

cd stock-price-prediction-ml



\# Create virtual environment
